        "The footer is rendered at the bottom of every page via the root layout (layout.tsx)",
        "The footer uses a bold pink color scheme (gradient from pink-400 to pink-600 or similar) that is visually distinct from the rest of the app",
        "The footer includes at least one funky design element (wave/curved SVG top border, decorative pattern, playful typography, or CSS animation) with SVG decorative elements having aria-hidden='true'",
        "The footer displays the TaskFlow brand name and copyright line (e.g. 'TaskFlow 2026')",
        "The footer includes at least three navigation links (e.g. Home, About, Privacy) styled for legibility against the pink background with visible hover/focus states",
        "On desktop (md+), footer content is laid out horizontally; on mobile (<md), content stacks vertically and is centered",
        "Dark mode support: footer uses a darker/muted pink variant (e.g. dark:bg-pink-900) with legible text in both themes"
